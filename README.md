Code of Assignment-3 for Algorithm-Design-analysis(CS60007) subject taught at ITKGP Mtech 1st sem (AUTUMN 2020)

Problem statement : 
 
(a) Write a program to randomly generate n distinct points such that their coordinates are integers in the range [20, 800] and divisible by 20.
    Store the value of n and the coordinates of all n points in a plain text file named points.txt.

(b) Write another program that reads the file points.txt and constructs its convex hull using divide and conquer. Visualize the left convex hull 
    in red and the right one in blue.
    For the left convex hull, find the convex hulls of the points lying in its interior, and visualize them as above.
    For the right one, do similar.
    So, finally, hierarchical convex hulls will be formed.
    Save the final result as an svg file named hull.svg in which all n points are colored black and hull edges colored red / blue.
